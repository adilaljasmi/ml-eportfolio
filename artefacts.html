            <blockquote>
                "This case study illustrates the limitations of a purely Industry 4.0 approach that prioritised technological efficiency over human-centric design and resilience. An Industry 5.0 approach to social statistics would have prioritised human-centric design, emphasised resilience, and focused on social value."

            <h5>Response to Saeed's British Airways Analysis</h5>
            <blockquote>
                "Infrastructure Resilience: The primary failure stemmed from inadequate power supply redundancy. British Airways should have implemented multiple backup power systems with automatic failover capabilities, including uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and geographically distributed data centers."
