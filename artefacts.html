            <h4>Discussion Forum: "Industry 4.0 and 5.0 in Social Statistics"</h4>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 5 September 2025</p>
            <p><strong>Topic:</strong> Analysis of the Australian 2016 Census System Failure and transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 principles</p>
            <blockquote>
                "This case study illustrates the limitations of a purely Industry 4.0 approach that prioritised technological efficiency over human-centric design and resilience. An Industry 5.0 approach to social statistics would have prioritised human-centric design, emphasised resilience, and focused on social value."
