            <blockquote>
                "This case study illustrates the limitations of a purely Industry 4.0 approach that prioritised technological efficiency over human-centric design and resilience. An Industry 5.0 approach to social statistics would have prioritised human-centric design, emphasised resilience, and focused on social value."

            <h4>Peer Analysis Assignment: Applying EDA Principles to System Failure Cases</h4>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 6 September 2025</p>
            <p><strong>Assignment Focus:</strong> Application of exploratory data analysis techniques to peer-submitted case studies of IT system failures</p>
            
            <h5>Response to Saeed's British Airways Analysis</h5>
            <blockquote>
                "Infrastructure Resilience: The primary failure stemmed from inadequate power supply redundancy. British Airways should have implemented multiple backup power systems with automatic failover capabilities, including uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and geographically distributed data centers."
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>EDA Skills Demonstrated:</strong> Systematic feature exploration of failure patterns, anomaly detection in infrastructure data, root cause analysis methodology</p>
            
            <h5>Response to Tasnika's Maersk Cybersecurity Analysis</h5>
            <blockquote>
                "Network Segmentation: Maersk should have implemented robust network segmentation to isolate critical operational technology (OT) systems from information technology (IT) networks. This would have prevented ransomware from spreading across global operations."
            </blockquote>
